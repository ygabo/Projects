1.c)
i. max_tr is faster
ii. The difference is more significant when the lists are bigger.
iii. The relative difference depends on the length of the list since
	head recursion has to track back to finish up all the function calls
	This means that whenever the length of the list increases, the head recursion
	has double the work relative to the tail recursions work.
