Leadership to me, means stepping up to the plate by providing guidance to whomever you are working with. It's knowing how to achieve success by maximizing the use of resources that are available; be the resources your team mates' skills, time, technology, etc. 

It is something that makes your team want to work with you, rather than making them feel like they work for you.
